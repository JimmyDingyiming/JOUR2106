#Who am I?
Hi, Everyone, this is Jimmy, a year 4 student from Financial Journalism. I know *nothing* about coding or data :joy::joy::joy: However, I believe data visulization is especially important as it can tell a more vivid story. More and more news are using data to tell a story. Financial news are strongly related to data and I believe wonderful news stories can be made by combining data visulization and  professional news writing.  
##What do I expect from the course?
Technique level|Social level

###What topic I am looking for?
